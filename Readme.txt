'audio' folder is expected to be in the same folder as 'dtwcode.m' file
'audio' folder should contain all the wav files (without any subfolders) for which mfcc features are to be extracted and alignment is to be done using DTW
modify variables 'file1' and 'file2' in line 3 and 4 to the names of the audio files that are to be aligned
modify line 7 so that 'a' contains only files with .wav extension (in case of any error)
